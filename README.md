# About the Project : CloseBuy 
Our project aims to provide an end-to-end hyperlocal platform to connect local entrepreneurs with customers within their location and equipping them with tools to bring their services online and find customers quickly and easily.

# The Problem Statement :
1. Local entreprenuers lack exposure of their small businesses due to societal constraints. 
2. These local entreprenuers find difficulty in acquiring initial customers and scaling their business.
3. Normal consumers have to spend a lot of time looking for a good tailor for tight deadlines for an event or house helps , baby sitters or any other work , nearby.

## How it all works : 
1. Customers could “Make a Wish” for the service they’re looking for from the comforts of their home.
2. Local entrepreneurs within a certain vicinity could see the request and respond, thus being a platform for fulfilment.
3. Entrepreneurs could connect with manufacturers/suppliers for raw materials from the comfort of their mobile phones.
4. Secured and Logged Transactions for every wish created on our very own BlockChain

# SWOT Analysis
1. Strengths : Providing support to local talent and providing opportunities for extra income . The platform can also be used as means of finding local freelance opprtunities.
2. Weakness : As with any new model , proper focus needs to be given in order to improve and make the peer to peer local interactions as smooth and efficient as possibe. This   is surely a huge task , but we at CloseBuy are committed to make this happen .
3. Opportunities : There exists a single global market while on the other hand , there exists millions of local ones. Catering to people at a local scale makes the model more scalable and more efficient while also providing employment and economic opportunities to people .

# Tech Stack Used

## Frameworks :
- [x] Firebase (Backend) , Firestore (NoSQL Database)
- [x] FCM (Notifications , Cloud Functions and Auth
- [x] Flutter (Dart) - Cross Platform device compatibility
- [x] Google Maps (SDK) - Geolocation
- [x] google_maps_flutter_1.2.0 - Flutter Library for Google Maps
- [x] Flask  - Implementation of the IBN
- [x] PyTezos - Implementing the base58 encoding

## API's :
Data is pivotal for the proper delivery of services. The CloseBuy App uses a few APIs Under the Hood which have been listed here :
- [x] Places API - Place search functions and autocomplete
- [x] Geocoding API (Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding) – Precise location data
- [x] Identity Toolkit API – Implementations of Auth functions
- [x] MoiBit API - For writing files to the Matic BlockChain

# App Architecture :
**BLoC (Business Logic Components)** . The gist of BLoC is that everything in the app should be represented as stream of events: widgets submit events; other widgets will respond. BLoC sits in the middle, managing the conversation. Dart even comes with syntax for working with streams that is baked into the language!

# Future Roadmap
Apart from the great experience and the edges to which this great hackathion has pushed our coding skills , we as a team are commited to take CloseBuy to the next level and convert it to a practical real world application. We as a team are committed to implement and integrate the following in future :

1. **Beta Testing of the App** : Any  product is incomplete without the feedback of consumers and subsequent reiterations. We at CloseBuy are also committed to make this journey as smooth as possible 
2. We also aim to integrate the **Custom BlockChain API** which we have designed in house with our App 
3. Last but not the least we also aim at **providing detailed analytics** based on consumer data to licensed advertisers via a dashboard or API so as to facilitate targeting of customers more accurately

# Business Model
Any Company or service provider requires a positive cash inflow in order to make sure that it can provide quality services to all its customers . We at CloseBuy are commited to do the same and have brainstormed a number of possible revenue streams which are listed as follow :
1. Data sharing with e-commerce and analytics companies.
2. Partnering with delivery and logistics companies for last mile deliveries through the women entrepreneurs.
3. Charging service fee from manufacturers/suppliers when they make a bulk sale through the platform
